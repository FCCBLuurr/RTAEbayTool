RTAEbayTool
===========
# Welcome to the Readme
This project was started so my co-workers could do the parts of their job that entail the most tedius and time consuming aspects of 
being in an auction/ebay company within a very niche industry that is predominately comprised of no-tech to low-tech solutions and 
few technicaly-inclined individuals (who wants to keep track of 5000 items in a spreadsheet, spanning across multiple sales channels).

I am a Software Developement student and learning Data Engineering on my own, most of my knowledge in coding is self-taught. So this is
part of my education and development of skills to work as a developer within properly setup development environments and release pipelines.

I have given this project the Unlicensed License, more or less as placeholder, but also because I believe open-source is the biggest step
foward in tech and development. As such, there will be no compiled releases on this repo. You will have to get this to a running state yourself.

Below this paragraph will be the directions to use this app. Please follow them carefully. Ps. If you go through the flickr output when uploading photos, there's a little easter egg from the devs over there.
